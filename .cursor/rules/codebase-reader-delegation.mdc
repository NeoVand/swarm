# Use codebase-reader for Deep Codebase Questions

When the user (or the task) needs **deep codebase understanding**, **architecture overviews**, **"how does X work" in detail**, or **mapping of modules/data flow**, delegate to the **codebase-reader** subagent instead of reading the whole codebase yourself.

**Delegate when the user:**
- Asks how something works in the codebase in detail
- Wants an architecture or module overview
- Asks to map or trace data flow, types, or dependencies
- Needs a thorough answer that would require reading many files

**How to delegate:** Invoke the codebase-reader subagent with a clear question or scope (e.g. "Use the codebase-reader to explain how the WebGPU simulation pipeline works"). Use the subagent's summarized, cited answer as context. Only load specific files yourself if you need to edit them.

This keeps your context free for implementation and follow-up work.
